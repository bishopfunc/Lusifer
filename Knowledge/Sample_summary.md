## Preferred Characteristics
1. **Strong Vocal Performances**: The user highly rates artists known for their vocal abilities, like Adele and Lauren Daigle. Music featuring strong, expressive vocal performances is likely to be appreciated.
2. **Emotional and Lyrical Depth**: Songs that contain meaningful lyrics with a deep emotional impact are preferred. This includes music that tells a story or conveys heartfelt emotions effectively.
